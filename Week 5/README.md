### Depth First Search
1. The exploration path is not what I would have initially expected. However, looking further it appears Pacman may prioritize certain directions over others. After considering this, the exploration path can be expected or predicted but will not always be the best path. Pacman does not go to all the explored squares on his way to the goal
2. This solution is not the least cost solution. The algorithm may explore depths without the least cost answer first.
