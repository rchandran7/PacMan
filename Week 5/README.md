The Pacman board will show an overlay of the states explored, and the order in which they were explored (brighter red means earlier exploration). Is the exploration order what you would have expected? Does Pacman actually go to all the explored squares on his way to the goal?
### Depth First Search
1. The exploration is not what I would have initially expected. However, looking further it appears Pacman prioritizes certain directions. For example, in the medium maze it is clear that Pacman priorities the West direction over the South. After considering this, the exploration path is expected but not always the best. Pacman does not go to all the explored squares on his way to the goal
