The Pacman board will show an overlay of the states explored, and the order in which they were explored (brighter red means earlier exploration). Is the exploration order what you would have expected? Does Pacman actually go to all the explored squares on his way to the goal?
### Depth First Search
1. The exploration path is not what I would have initially expected. However, looking further it appears Pacman may prioritize certain directions over others. After considering this, the exploration path can be expected or predicted but will not always be the best path. Pacman does not go to all the explored squares on his way to the goal
